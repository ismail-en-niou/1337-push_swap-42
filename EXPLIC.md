# Understanding the 0.048 Factor in push_swap

In the **push_swap** project, a common strategy for optimizing sorting operations is to divide the stack into **ranges (chunks)**. A key constant used in defining these ranges is **0.048**, which is multiplied by the size of the stack to determine the chunk size.

This document explains how **0.048** is derived mathematically.

## 1. The Sorting Principle

The push_swap project often utilizes a **chunk-based sorting approach**, where elements are divided into manageable groups for efficient sorting. The optimal chunk size is determined based on:

- **QuickSort partitioning behavior** (which follows an **O(n log n)** complexity).
- **Empirical testing** to determine an efficient range size.
- **Logarithmic scaling** to adapt chunk sizes as the stack grows.

---

## 2. Derivation of the 0.048 Constant

### Step 1: Estimating the Number of Chunks
From QuickSort behavior, an optimal way to partition data is:

\[
\text{chunks} = \frac{n}{\log(n)}
\]

where:
- **n** is the stack size.
- **log(n)** represents the logarithmic growth of partitions.

Thus, the fraction of the stack in each chunk is:

\[
\frac{\text{chunk size}}{n} = \frac{1}{\log(n)}
\]

---

### Step 2: Finding the Approximate Ratio

For an empirically efficient sorting approach, the constant **0.048** is chosen. We approximate:

\[
\frac{1}{\log(n)} \approx 0.048
\]

Solving for **n**:

\[
\log(n) \approx \frac{1}{0.048} = 20.83
\]

Taking the exponent:

\[
n \approx e^{20.83} \approx 1.1 \times 10^9
\]

Since push_swap usually deals with **n = 100 to 500**, this suggests an **empirical adjustment** is needed to fit practical stack sizes.

---

### Step 3: Correcting for Real-World Stack Sizes

For practical values of **n**, the approximation:

\[
\frac{1}{4.5 \log(n)}
\]

better fits the **0.048 coefficient** for stacks in the range of **100 to 500**.

| Stack Size (n) | \( 1 / \log(n) \) | Approximate Percentage |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| 100          | \( 1/4.6 \approx 0.217 \) | 21.7%  |
| 500          | \( 1/6.2 \approx 0.161 \) | 16.1%  |
| 1000         | \( 1/6.9 \approx 0.145 \) | 14.5%  |
| 5000         | \( 1/8.5 \approx 0.117 \) | 11.7%  |

Since these values are **too large**, an empirically tuned factor **0.048** ensures a balanced trade-off between efficiency and chunk sizes.

---

## 3. Conclusion
- The **0.048 constant** is a practical approximation based on **logarithmic scaling**.
- The formula:
  
  \[
  \frac{1}{4.5 \log(n)}
  \]
  
  provides a theoretical justification for why **0.048** works well in push_swap.
- This factor ensures efficient partitioning while maintaining a reasonable number of operations for sorting.
