# push_swap# Push_Swap Project - 42 School

## Overview
The **Push_Swap** project at 42 School challenges you to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations on two stacks. The goal is to minimize the number of operations while adhering to strict coding standards.

This document outlines the key concepts and learning objectives to successfully complete and validate the project.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Algorithm Design and Complexity
- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Understand basic sorting techniques such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort (concept), and Quick Sort (concept).
  - Optimize your solution to minimize the number of operations.
- **Big-O Notation:**
  - Analyze the time and space complexity of your sorting algorithm.

### 2. Data Structures
- **Stacks:**
  - Implement stacks using arrays or linked lists.
  - Master operations like push, pop, swap, rotate, and reverse rotate.
- **Linked Lists (optional):**
  - Use doubly linked lists for more efficient rotations and reversals.

### 3. Programming Skills
- **C Programming:**
  - Master pointers, memory allocation, and function modularity.
  - Handle edge cases and errors effectively.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Validate input and manage invalid scenarios gracefully.

### 4. Push-Swap Operations
- **Mandatory Operations:**
  - `sa`, `sb`, `ss`: Swap the first two elements.
  - `pa`, `pb`: Push an element from one stack to another.
  - `ra`, `rb`, `rr`: Rotate stack upwards.
  - `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`: Reverse rotate stack downwards.
- **Sorting Logic:**
  - Develop a strategy to sort the stack efficiently using the least operations.

### 5. Algorithm Optimization
- **Divide and Conquer:**
  - Break the problem into smaller subsets (e.g., sort in chunks).
- **Greedy Algorithm:**
  - Optimize immediate moves for the best short-term results.
- **Small Dataset Sorting:**
  - Implement optimized solutions for datasets of size 3, 5, or 100.

### 6. Testing and Debugging
- **Input Handling:**
  - Test edge cases such as:
    - Empty input.
    - Duplicates.
    - Non-numeric characters.
- **Debugging:**
  - Use debugging tools such as `printf` and `gdb`.
- **Checker Program:**
  - Write a program to verify the validity of your operations and ensure the stack is sorted.

### 7. Norminette and 42 Standards
- Follow 42's coding norms, including:
  - Proper indentation and formatting.
  - Limited function line count.
  - No global variables.
  - Error-free compilation with `-Wall -Werror -Wextra`.
